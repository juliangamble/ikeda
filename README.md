Idea Clojure GUI Demo. 
Beauty of the mathematics of a sinkhole - captured in a Clojure GUI

[Lau B. Jensen](http://www.bestinclass.dk/kontakt.html) wrote an amazing blog post 
[called Theory vs Clojure](http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2009/09/chaos-theory-vs-clojure.html)

Here he described how to develop in Clojure a discrete-time dynamic system called An Ikeda map. 

Rich Hickey then submitted his improvements to the code. This demo is Rich Hickey's version.
